    "Where was the data currently stored in this dataset sourced from": "My Own Storage Infra",
    "How do you plan to prepare the dataset": "1.Data Organization and Classification: We will categorize all media materials, such as images, videos, and documents. Each type of data will be divided into appropriate batches to facilitate subsequent uploading and management.\n2.Data Format and Compression: To ensure efficient data transmission and storage, we will perform appropriate format conversion and compression on the media data. Video files will be compressed using common formats such as MP4, images will use formats like JPEG or PNG, and documents will remain in standard formats such as PDF or DOCX.\n3.Data Encryption and Verification: To ensure data security, we will encrypt the data before uploading using standard encryption techniques like AES. At the same time, we will generate a hash value of the data to verify the integrity and consistency of the data after it is uploaded.\n4.Upload Tools: In terms of upload tools, we plan to use commonly used tools in the Filecoin ecosystem, such as Estuary or Lotus, to ensure the data is uploaded to the Filecoin network. We will choose appropriate tools for batch uploads based on the scale and type of data.\n5.Node Selection: To ensure high availability and retrieval efficiency, we will collaborate with storage providers (SPs) that meet the Filecoin Plus requirements. This will ensure that data is stored on multiple geographically distributed nodes with sufficient backup mechanisms.",
