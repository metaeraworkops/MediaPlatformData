### 2. Document Verification
Clients must submit at least one of the following:

- Company website with screenshot of intro page
- Public proof of business operations (e.g. press releases)
- Data usage statement (origin, format, scenario, and purpose)

## üì¶ Data Diligence Process

### 1. Sample Submission
Clients are required to submit sufficient sample data to demonstrate the authenticity, structure, and business relevance of their dataset.

- Since the data often involves **media content**, clients may choose whether samples should be publicly accessible or kept confidential (e.g., shared privately or encrypted).
- Sample size and format are reviewed on a case-by-case basis depending on the dataset type and deal scope.

### 2. Verification Standards
Submitted samples will be reviewed based on the following criteria:

- Files must be **non-empty**, relevant, and reflect the declared data purpose.


### 3. Data Confidentiality Options
If a client requests that their data samples remain confidential (e.g., due to licensing or business sensitivity):

- We will still require sufficient **proof of validity** via sample inspection or signed documentation.
- Confidential samples may be reviewed **privately by governance** or included as part of audit disclosures when necessary.
